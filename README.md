**MY WARDROBE HQ** is the UKâ€™s first fashion rental marketplace; a leading destination for renting and buying contemporary and luxury womenswear fashion; launched in November 2019 with a selection of clothes and accessories from over 500 designers including Stella McCartney, Gucci, Prada and many, many more.

MWHQ is a social shopping platform with a sustainable heart, one that is fully circular by allowing users to `rent and monetise` their own wardrobes. The unique **`buy and rent model`** allows consumers to `try before they buy`, with no hidden catches.


# Summarize project idea
We will extract data from the women's clothing catalog of MyWardrobe HQ, and after cleaning the data to a sufficient degree for our analysis, we will answer questions such as:

Which are the most represented brands on the website?
Which are the most expensive brands?
What is the difference between the rental price of a clothing item vs outright buying the item?


And more. By using Insights derived from this analysis, we will offer our suggestions and conclustions, including the future scope of this project.
